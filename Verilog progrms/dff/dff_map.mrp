Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1108 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <clk> is placed at site <PAD37>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <clk_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y3>. There is only a
   select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they
   are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and
   correct it. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you
   may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf file to demote this
   message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is
   listed below. These examples can be used directly in the .ucf file to
   override this clock rule.
   < NET "clk" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc6slx4' is a WebPack part.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
